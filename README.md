## Signinup_back
This project contains the backend of Signinup flow in **React** which is required every now and then, I've created this repository such that anyone in order to focus on his/her main project can pic this and continue to the main project.

**Frontend [here](https://github.com/abhinavsri360/React-Signin-Signup_flow)** Backend is created using mongodb, express and passport. Contributors are welcome.

All you need is a URI that's all and you can have this flow up and running anytime anywhere.

Contributions will be a great help as this is still under construction.

Thank you so much for visiting this repository :heart: Liked this? :star: Want to Contribute? :fork_and_knife:

Contribution to this can be a huge step to Open-Source and a great help to many developers out here :smile:
